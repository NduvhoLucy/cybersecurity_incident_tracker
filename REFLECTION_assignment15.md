#  Reflection on Cross-Project Collaboration

Contributing to my classmates' repositories was a valuable and eye-opening experience. It gave me a better understanding of how real open-source collaboration works, especially when working with code that I didn’t originally write.

One of the biggest lessons I learned is the importance of good documentation. Projects that had a clear `README.md` and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file were much easier to understand and contribute to. When I found labeled issues like `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`, it made it easy to identify where I could help.

A challenge I faced was understanding each project’s structure. Even small contributions required some time to explore how files were organized and how functions were used. I had to be careful to follow each project’s coding style and folder structure to avoid breaking anything.

Overall, this activity helped build my confidence in contributing to other people’s code and working in a team-based environment. It also taught me to think like a maintainer, especially in terms of how I structure and document my own projects to make them easier for others to contribute to.

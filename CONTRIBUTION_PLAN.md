##  My Strategy

1. **Start with documentation fixes** to get familiar with each project (e.g., improving README structure and setup instructions).
2. Move on to **writing or improving test cases**, especially in projects that already have a test suite.
3. End with **a simple UI fix or minor feature**, such as fixing alignment, button behavior, or adding an alert box.
4. I will **comment on each selected issue** to confirm availability and avoid duplicating work.
5. Each contribution will follow the project's existing `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and coding conventions.

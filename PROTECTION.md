# Branch Protection Policy

## Why Branch Protection Rules Matter

Branch protection rules help enforce team collaboration and quality control during software development.

### ✅ Require Pull Request Reviews
- Ensures every code change is reviewed before being merged.
- Helps catch bugs, enforce standards, and encourage shared ownership.

### ✅ Require Status Checks
- Automated tests must pass before code is merged.
- Prevents broken or insecure code from being introduced to `main`.

### ✅ Disable Direct Pushes
- Forces all changes to go through pull requests.
- Maintains a traceable history of all changes.
- Encourages discussion, review, and accountability.

These rules simulate real-world DevOps practices and help maintain a professional development workflow.

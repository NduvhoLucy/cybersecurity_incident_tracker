### **What is a Kanban Board?**
A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that tracks tasks from start to finish using columns (e.g., To Do → In Progress → Done).

### **How This Board Supports Agile Workflow:**
1. **Visualizing Workflow:**
   - Each column represents a stage in the **incident tracking process**.
   - Issues move through the board as they progress.
2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP):**
   - Prevents overload by restricting tasks per column.
   - Ensures smooth task flow and prevents bottlenecks.
3. **Supporting Agile Principles:**
   - Encourages **continuous delivery** by keeping work items moving.
   - Adaptable to changing priorities and requirements.

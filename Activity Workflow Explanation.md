## Activity Workflow Explanations

The following activity diagrams model eight complex workflows from the Cybersecurity Incident Tracker system. Each workflow has been carefully designed to align with stakeholder concerns, system functionality, and Agile development priorities.

### 1. User Registration
This workflow ensures that only legitimate users gain access to the system by validating input and enforcing email verification. The process addresses security and user authenticity concerns raised by IT Admins and Compliance Officers, ensuring the platform is not misused by unauthorized individuals.

### 2. Log Security Incident
This workflow is crucial for timely response and documentation of cybersecurity threats. It allows Security Analysts to log incidents with supporting evidence, satisfying the SOC Manager's need for real-time visibility and incident accountability. It also ensures the data is stored securely and traceably for future audits.

### 3. Assign Incident to Analyst
This process delegates incident ownership to appropriate personnel. It supports SOC Managers by streamlining workload distribution and ensuring no incident remains unaddressed. Notifications help analysts respond quickly, improving operational responsiveness and threat containment.

### 4. Update Incident Status
This workflow allows analysts to update the status of assigned incidents, ensuring that stakeholders are informed of progress. It reinforces transparency and traceability, which are critical for Compliance Officers monitoring incident lifecycle and adherence to standard operating procedures.

### 5. Generate Security Report
Security reports are essential for decision-making and auditing. This workflow supports executives and compliance personnel by offering tailored reports filtered by type and date. The option to email or download reports caters to different documentation and sharing preferences, ensuring flexibility and accessibility.

### 6. Review Audit Logs
Audit log review enables IT Admins and Compliance Officers to track user actions for accountability and anomaly detection. The ability to filter and export logs supports investigations and regulatory compliance, enhancing the platform's trustworthiness and forensic capability.

### 7. User Authentication (Login with MFA)
This workflow strengthens system security through multi-factor authentication. It ensures only verified users access sensitive areas of the system, addressing IT Admin concerns around unauthorized access and enhancing compliance with cybersecurity best practices.

### 8. SIEM Integration Workflow
This workflow ensures seamless integration with external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. It supports proactive threat detection by exporting system events in real-time, enabling broader analysis and alerting across the cybersecurity ecosystem. This is vital for SOC Managers and IT Admins managing large-scale infrastructure.

Each workflow has been modeled with decisions, parallel actions, and role-based swimlanes where applicable. These activity diagrams not only support the functional requirements but also reflect a deep understanding of stakeholder needs and system priorities.

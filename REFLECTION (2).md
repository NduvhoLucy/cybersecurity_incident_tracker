## 1. Difficulty in Prioritization

Deciding which features were Must-have and Should-have was difficult. Every feature seemed critical, but I had to focus on core functionalities first. For instance, incident logging was prioritized over SIEM integration, which, while valuable, was not immediately necessary.

Balancing security and usability added another challenge. Security features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) were important for securing the system, but they also impacted user experience. To strike a balance, MFA was made optional for non-admin users, ensuring security while maintaining usability for the broader user base.

## 2. Challenges in Estimation

Estimating effort was difficult due to unknown technical complexities. While logging an incident was straightforward, integrating with SIEM systems involved many dependencies that were not immediately clear. Story points were used to estimate effort, but adjustments were necessary as development progressed. The unknowns in the project made it clear that estimation is a fluid process, requiring constant review and adjustment.

## 3. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs

Without external feedback, I had to rely on best practices and assumptions to align the project with stakeholder needs. Although I was the sole stakeholder, I considered the perspectives of different user roles (Security Analyst, SOC Manager, IT Admin) to help simulate what their needs and concerns might be. This approach was helpful, but it would have been more effective with direct input from actual stakeholders.

Adjusting the scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was another challenge. Initially, I had planned to include all features in the first sprint, but it became clear that this was too ambitious. To ensure meaningful progress, the scope was limited to the core features of logging incidents, assigning cases, and updating statuses. This allowed for incremental value delivery while keeping the project manageable.

## 4. Lessons Learned
- Breaking work into small, testable stories improves clarity and execution. This approach helps identify potential issues early on and provides a clear path for progress.
- Accepting uncertainty in estimation is crucial for flexibility. Estimation is rarely perfect, and the ability to adjust as the project progresses is essential for maintaining momentum.
- Considering multiple stakeholder perspectives —even in the absence of direct feedback—helps in making better decisions. It’s essential to think about the different roles the product will serve to ensure it meets the needs of all potential users.
